todo:

1/7/19
media query between 999 and 768, the project page has distorted images

below 1024 need to add space at the top and between elements 

above 1024, most of it looks good.






look for new "project link" buttons to replace arrows
what links need to be on the left side of home page?


updates to do;

x change the rounded corners of link buttons to match the name block corners

x All caps on the link buttons

- make the link button fonts the same as the projects link

- improve the hover effect on the projects link

x remove the navbar on desktop screen

projects

- add a picture of the project instead of a lot of words

- move location of github and heroku links. change heroku to say Visit or Delpoyed

x add target="_blank" to open in new window

- adjust the top button to show up sooner on projects page

skillz

x maybe change the C:/ image

x add the effect on react that clay used

x new image for html/css?

x remove footer

x use icon set for the contact links
